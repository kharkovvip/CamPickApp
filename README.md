CamPickApp (min API 19 ver. 4.4.2):
I've created an application that does:
- pick photo from camera or gallery;
- creates the appropriate folder in the device's file system and saves the new images in it with the specified name;
- forms an e-mail from the completed fields;
- save drafts and sent messages;
- sends the message to the recipient via device email client;
- can edit saved drafts and resend them;
- removing unnecessary drafts.
